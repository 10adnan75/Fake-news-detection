# Fake News Detection using Scikit-learn

Using the sci-kit package from Python, several natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms were employed to classify false news stories in this research.

## Getting Started

For development and testing reasons, follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local system. Notes on how to deploy the project on a live system can be found in the deployment section.

### Prerequisites

What you'll need to install the software, and how to do it:

1. Python 3.9 
   - This setup requires that you have Python 3.9 installed on your PC. To get Python, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/. Once you've downloaded and installed Python, you'll need to set up PATH variables (if you want to run a Script directly, see the *how to run software section* for more information). See https://www.pythoncentral.io/add-python-to-path-python-is-not-recognized-as-an-internal-or-external-command/ for more information.
   - Setting up the PATH variable is optional; you can run the application without it, and more information is provided below.
2. The second and more convenient way is to download Anaconda and run the commands using its anaconda prompt. To get Anaconda, go to https://www.anaconda.com/download/.
3. After you've installed python or anaconda using the procedures above, you'll need to download and install the following three packages.
   - Sklearn (scikit-learn)
   - numpy
   - scipy
   
  - If you want to install Python 3.9, use the command prompt/terminal to run the commands listed below.
   ```
   pip install -U scikit-learn
   pip install numpy
   pip install scipy
   ```
   - If you've decided to use Anaconda, use the instructions below in the Anaconda prompt to install these packages.
   ```
   conda install -c scikit-learn
   conda install -c anaconda numpy
   conda install -c anaconda scipy
   ```
